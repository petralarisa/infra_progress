# infra_progress
for demo purposes

my to do list for next week:
- Just in case for demo, prepare the infrastructure using sandbox too as a backup material
- Use the subnets calculated by misak
- Incorporate ELB 
- play around adding more AZ
- Investigate more into why the .id property isn't working
- consult with Lisa for feedback
